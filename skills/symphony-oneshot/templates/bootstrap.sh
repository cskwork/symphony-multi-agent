✓ Symphony OneShot bootstrapped at $PROJECT_ROOT/.oneshot/
✓ WORKFLOW.md installed (any prior one backed up)
✓ INTAKE-1 created in lane: Brief
✓ Project root pinned: $PROJECT_ROOT (also written to .oneshot/.project_root)

Next step:

  # interactive (needs a TTY)
  symphony tui ./WORKFLOW.md

  # headless (recommended when an orchestrator session is driving)
  symphony ./WORKFLOW.md --port 9999 2>> log/symphony.log &

Then poll:
  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/state | jq '.counts'

The loop is done when DELIVER-1 reaches state 'Delivered' AND
.oneshot/vault/delivery.md exists. For browser apps,
.oneshot/vault/artifacts/qa-report.pdf must also exist with the sha256
matching .oneshot/vault/artifacts/qa-report.pdf.sha256.
